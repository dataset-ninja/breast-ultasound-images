The authors of the **Breast Ultrasound Images Dataset** address breast cancer, a leading cause of mortality among women globally, emphasizing the importance of early detection for reducing fatalities. The dataset pertains to medical images obtained through ultrasound scans for breast cancer assessment.

The data collection process involved gathering baseline ultrasound images of breasts from women aged between 25 and 75 years. This data accumulation was conducted in the year 2018, encompassing a total of 600 female patients. The dataset comprises 780 images, each with an average size of 500 × 500 pixels, and is stored in PNG format. The images are systematically divided into the three classes: *normal*, *benign*, and *malignant*.

The procedure for dataset collection involved capturing grayscale ultrasound images, which were stored in DICOM format at Baheya hospital. This comprehensive endeavor, including image collection and annotation, spanned approximately a year. Initially, 1100 images were gathered; however, following data preprocessing, the dataset was refined to 780 images. To eliminate redundant information and improve the dataset quality, radiologists from Baheya hospital reviewed and corrected erroneous annotations. LOGIQ E9 ultrasound systems and LOGIQ E9 Agile ultrasound systems were employed for image acquisition, producing images with a resolution of 1280 × 1024. The transducers utilized were 1–5 MHz on an ML6-15-D Matrix linear probe.

After data collection, preprocessing was executed to enhance dataset utility. Duplicate images were removed, and incorrect annotations were rectified through expert radiologist review. Conversion from DICOM to PNG format was achieved utilizing a DICOM converter application. Refinement procedures led to a reduction in the dataset size, resulting in 780 ultrasound images. To enhance dataset quality, images were cropped to different sizes, effectively eliminating extraneous boundaries. Fast photo crops facilitated this cropping process. The inclusion of image annotation into the image name was performed, and rigorous validation by Baheya hospital radiologists ensured data integrity.

Ground truth annotation plays a pivotal role in enhancing the dataset's utility. This annotation was carried out using Matlab, where a freehand segmentation technique was employed for each image.
