**Breast Ultrasound Images** is a dataset for instance segmentation and object detection tasks. It is used in the medical industry.

The dataset consists of 780 images with 647 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*tumor*).

Images in the Breast Ultrasound Images dataset have pixel-level semantic segmentation annotations. Due to the nature of the semantic segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into an object detection (bounding boxes for every object) task. There are 133 (17% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 3 splits in the dataset: *benign* (437 images), *malignant* (210 images), and *normal* (133 images). The dataset was released in 2021.

Here are the visualized examples for each of the 1 classes:
