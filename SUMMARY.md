**Breast Ultrasound Images** is a dataset for semantic segmentation and object detection tasks. It is used in the medical industry. 

The dataset consists of 780 images with 647 labeled objects belonging to 2 different classes including *benign* and *malignant*.

Images in the Breast Ultrasound Images dataset have pixel-level semantic segmentation annotations. There are 133 (17% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are no pre-defined <i>train/val/test</i> splits in the dataset. Alternatively, the dataset could be split into 3 classification sets: ***benign*** (437 images), ***malignant*** (210 images), and ***normal*** (133 images). The dataset was released in 2021 by the Cairo University, Egypt.
