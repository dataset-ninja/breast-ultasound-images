**Breast Ultrasound Images** is a dataset for a semantic segmentation task. It is used in the medical industry. 

The dataset consists of 780 images with 647 labeled objects belonging to 3 different classes including *benign*, *malignant*, and *normal*.

Images in the Breast Ultrasound Images dataset have pixel-level semantic segmentation annotations. There are 133 (17% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are no pre-defined <i>train/val/test</i> splits in the dataset. The dataset was released in 2021 by the Cairo University, Egypt.
